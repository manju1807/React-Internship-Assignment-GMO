# React Internship Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the React Internship Assignment. The assignment focuses on building a robust React application using Typescript, Vite, and Material-UI (MUI). It includes features such as user information collection, data fetching from an API, and the implementation of a critical expandable/collapsible department list component.

## Tasks Completed:

- Application configuration with Typescript, Vite, and MUI.
- First page with a user information form and local storage integration.
- Second page with a table displaying data from a JSON API.
- Implementation of a critical department list component with expandable/collapsible functionality.

## Deployment:

The application is deployed and accessible at [https://react-internship-assignment-gmo.netlify.app/](https://react-internship-assignment-gmo.netlify.app/).
